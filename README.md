# scoop bash completion

A [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell completion for [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) -- a command-line installer for Windows.

## Installation

Copy the `scoop-completion.sh` file to directory with other completions, for example `~/bin/bash_completion.d/` or source directly.

## Configuration

If a faster completion, but lacking package names, is desired export `SCOOP_COMPLETION_NO_LISTS` with a non-empty value.
